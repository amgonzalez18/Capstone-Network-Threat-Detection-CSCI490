# Capstone-Network-Threat-Detection-CSCI490
This is my senior project where I am building a home lab that simulates network traffic and attacks and then applies a machine learning model that will be an intrusion detection pipeline to detect threats in a network system. The detections will be visualized in a Flutter Firebase dashboard app, giving a Red Team vs. Blue Team workforce scenario
